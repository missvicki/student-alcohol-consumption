# student-alcohol-consumption

## Summary
This analysis examines factors related to a student’s final grade and how alcohol consumption influences that grade. 
Implementation of exploratory data analysis and stepwise selection help in determining the linear regression model. 
It is discovered that a student will attain a higher final grade if they have excellent first and second-period grades, excellent family relationships, or live far away from school tend to perform better than students who live less than 15 min from school. According to the analysis, female students or students who frequently go out drink a lot over the weekend. 
Alternatively, students who attend Mousinho da Silveira or study a lot, or have no romantic relationships drink less during the weekdays.
